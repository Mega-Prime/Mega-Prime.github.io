          <div class="post-content">

            <p>More than often we talk about what makes us <em>unhappy</em>. This only brings
            more negative energy to our day to day lives. I am not saying it is not important
           to <em>acknowledge</em> things that may not be the best of situations in our lives, but
         to an extent. Lingering on these things won't help.</p>

         <p><strong>Speak what makes you happy</strong>. Today is a day to recognize the things that
         put a smile on your face, and warms your heart. It is <strong>healthy</strong>. It fosters a life
         of <strong>exuberance</strong>.</p>

         <p><em>Speak what makes you happy</em>.</p>

          <div class="post-content">

            <p>If you <em>did the work</em>, you deserve the <strong>success</strong>. I had an interesting
            discussion with a friend about waiting to be recognized for the hard work
          they have done. Feeling like you are not being acknowledged for the hard work you do,
        whether that be positive words of <strong>affirmation, a promotion, or bonus</strong>, can be draining on
      your <em>motivation</em>.</p>

      <p>I will say this, you <strong>DO NOT</strong> have to be <em>patient</em> about your success. If you have done the work,
      you deserve the recognition. Take a step back, evaluate if you have done what is required, and if you
    have to step away from your current opportunity for greener pastures, <strong>DO SO!</strong></p>

    <p>Did the work? <em>Don't be patient about your success</em>.</p>

          <div class="post-content">

            <p>Sometimes in life we are moving to fast. So fast that we cannot see
            the next turn ahead, or we fly by an opportunity. Moving at the <strong>speed
          of life</strong> can surely cause a crash.</p>

          <p><em>Slow down</em>. It's ok to get some fresh air and take a break from the hustle
          and bustle of today's high speed madness.</p>

            <p>I am strong. I am a fighter. I have persevered through many things.
              But I was <em>afraid</em>. So I could only imagine Annie's fears when at 29yrs

            <p>Life changed. I felt helpless watching someone I love and care for go
              through What went from a daily dose of positive energy filled with smiles
            and laughter, to chemo treatments, radiation, and surgeries. Life changed, But Annie Marra
           stood tall and began her walk on that long road to <strong>kicking cancers ass!</strong></p>

          <h3 class="post-title">Conscious Communication</h3>
          <div class="post-content">

            <p><em>Communication</em> is a deadly art form. It can kill common misconceptions,
               break through moments of disparity, ignite the flames of team work,
               or help you order a pizza! We all know I love pizza.
          </p>

          <p>But communication can also be detrimental to all of those things.
          Lack of it, can <strong>burn</strong> bridges built, and destroy rapport between two people,
        or even groups of people. Assuming someone understands your needs and want is not
      communication. It is exactly that, an assumption. </p>

          <p>Be mindful of what others may or may not know. <strong>Conscious Communication</strong>.
           What that means is, make the effort to <em><u>explicitly</u></em> open the line for listening
           and conversation. What goes un-said gets <strong>misinterpreted</strong>,
            <strong>misunderstood</strong>, and leaves others <strong>mis-informed</strong>.
         </p>

         <p><em>Be conscious of your communication.</em></p>

          <h3 class="post-title">Unconditional</h3>
          <div class="post-content">

            <p>I believe nothing in life is <strong>unconditional</strong>. Often we speak of <em>"unconditional love"</em>,
            or doing things for self and others without reserve. But everything has circumstance.</p>

            <p>Even the idea of the word <strong>"Unconditional"</strong> itself can and should only be reserved for
            law or contracts. When you think about it, even that is a state of affairs that in itself, is
           yes you guessed it, a <strong>condition</strong>.</p>

           <p>I say all this because success comes with <em>dependencies</em>. Dependencies based on the condition
           that you will put in the efforts needed of you to <strong>learn, grow, and acquire</strong> the right <u>tools</u>
         to build <em>prosperity</em>. </p>

         <p>Don't get hung up on looking for some unconditional value in things, or others that
         even with the deepest reflections within, you wont find in self. Instead focus your <em>level of effort</em>
       toward creating <strong>opportunity</strong> on the conditions the world has set in front of you.</p>

          <div class="post-content">

            <p>The recipe for success includes, but not limited to, <em>time, effort,
            understanding, teaching and learning</em>. In order to take the reins of <strong>triumph</strong>
          you have to have <u>enthusiasm</u>.</p>

          <p>The <strong>energy to succeed</strong> takes one major ingredient, <em>A PLAN!</em> You can <em>work, work, work,</em>
          but if you do not have a plan for your <strong>physical</strong> and <strong>mental</strong> health and well-being,
        you will fail yourself by falling apart.</p>

        <p>Don't let the cliche's of the world fool you that running your tank empty seven days a week
        is the way to success.</p>

        <p>Repeat after me, <em>"Smarter not Harder!"</em>. Make a real plan. Refine it as needed.
        Rejuvenate self, and you will have the <strong>energy to succeed</strong>.</p>

          <div class="post-content">
            <p>Sometimes we make the mistake of giving up on something because we
            don't know enough about it, or it gets a little tough.</p>

            <p>We spend days wondering how to do something, or even why we should.
            We start. We stop. We have questions, but we never ask for answers. We
           start to believe we aren't <em>"good enough"</em>.</p>

           <p>Well...That's not true! <em>You are <strong>good enough</strong></em>. Not knowing something
           only means you have the opportunity to learn more about it. Means you can,
         and should work at getting better at it. Another example of
         <strong>"Level Of Effort Equals Opportunity"</strong>.</p>

         <p>Don't sell yourself short on succes, or great life experiences thinking
         you aren't good enough. The right amount of <strong>effort</strong>,
         and the <strong>willingness to learn</strong>, now that's a real recipe for <strong><em>triumph!</em></strong></p>

            <p>Remember that everyone learns the world around them differently. Sees
            the world around them differently, and understands the world around them
          differently. Choosing to accept them for who they are and willing to
           learn from their experiences, that's <strong>tolerance and understanding</strong>. </p>

            <p>Remember the best version of you will be tested daily. It is not
            the responsibility of others around you to keep you in check. It is
          you who should be cognizant of the face you present to the world. This does not
        at all imply we should fake who we are, but what we show is not always <em>"pretty"</em>.</p>

          <p>I know there are times where we might not be in the
          best of moods, or the best version of you might not be readily available,
          but remember, <strong><em>verison control</em></strong>. Your negative energy does not have
          to be what the world receives.
         </p>

         <p>Be mindful of what you say and who you say it to. It's not always what you say
           that is the issue, but <em>how</em> you say it.
         </p>

         <p>We are not always in a good mood...That is ok, we are <em>human</em>. But remember,

          <div class="post-content">
            <p>In our lives we have multiple forms of input. From <em>social media</em>,
            <em>network television</em>, and the infamous <em>internet</em>; What our minds ingest
          more than often controls the quality of our output.</p>

          <p><strong>Control</strong>. Manage the inputs in your life. Spending quality time with
          a good book, or learning a new skill to add to your toolbox helps shape
        a stronger mind, and more productive days. Controlling what your mind consumes
      contributes to the level of effort you are putting toward success.</p>

        <p><strong>Alter</strong>. We often find ourselves over-thinking situations, or consuming
        streams of negative thought or energy. Change the inputs in your life
      that are continual energy drains, and are founded in despondency. Sometimes,
    <em>less is more</em>, and in this instance, less pessimism is good for your productivity.</p>

      <p><strong>Delete</strong>. Understand what you want from your day, and remove the obstacles
      that are preventing you from achieving those goals. Whether that be
    procrastination, people, and whatever else in between, disconnect the inputs
    that chain you to mediocrity, negativity, and regression. </p>

            <p>Sometimes we work ourselves into a rut. We do so much to achieve

            <p>Be ok with taking a break. If you cannot <strong>breathe</strong>, you cannot <em>live</em>.
            What that means is, if you spend all your time thinking <em>"if you only work today,
              every day"</em>, when that tomorrow comes that you are working for, you will have run out of time to <u>enjoy</u> it.</p>

            <p>The bad new is, <em>there will always be bad news</em>. There will always
            be something that tries to tear you down and break your cycle of success.
            Things that will beat at your <strong>soul</strong>, your <strong>morale</strong>, and definitely your <strong>patience</strong>.
           There will always be bad news.</p>

            <p>But the good news, no. <em>NO!</em> The <u>great news</u> is, you have built a solid
            lasting foundation of <em>knowledge, strength, patience, and integrity</em>.
            So as that <em>"bad news"</em> starts to creep into your path of success and tries
            to derail your goals, your efforts toward greatness will not be shaken.</p>

            <p>Take a deep breathe. Step back. See the situation for what it is, and
            proceed as necessary. You can't win every battle, or every race. But you
           can create better opportunity for yourself by showing and proving that
          when bad news comes, you handle it with <strong>patience</strong> and <strong>intelligent</strong> actions.</p>

          <p>What makes her stronger, when she feels she can only bite and scratch<br>
           Uplifts her in praise & motivates her soul

            <p>To my brothers, sisters. To my son... </p>

            <p>As the sun rises on this day, I know your heart may be burdened.
             As we walk along this beach of existence, the waves of inequity crash
             upon our lives, engulfing us in uncertainty. The plight of some will
               be left bereft of life, as we wander dazed from a history that has
              only told us a forsaken truth; We are not welcome <em>"here"</em>. </p>

          <p>Though our hearts forgive, our minds are addled by the actions of some
            who are not yet ready for <strong>growth</strong>. Those who cannot see beyond the color
          of skin, or accept that time tells a terrible tale that though we <em>inherently</em>
            should believe that <strong>"All lives matter"</strong>, My life. My <strong>BLACK</strong> life does not matter
            if you are <em>"scared or uncomfortable"</em>.</p>

          <p>This is not a sentiment held by all, but to the aformentioned, I say,
            <em>By any means necessary...</em><strong><em>A CHANGE GON' COME!</em></strong></p>

            <p>Have you ever felt alone? Felt like things you do aren't good enough?
            Sometimes you feel like you've been on the bench so long, you don't know
            what to do to get back in the game? Feel like you're <em><u>not</u></em> ok? I get it.</p>

            <p>Today I feel that way, and maybe for a little while now I have felt this way.
             Often life throws you so many curve balls at once, you don't know what to swing at.
            You feel this weight of uncertainty, or maybe there has been loss of something, someone.
            You feel the highs drop so low. We are in a time of emotional, political, societal turmoil.
            <em>You're human. I get it.</em></p>

          <p>But let me tell you something you may not hear, or may need to hear again.
           Everything will be alright. It is ok to say <em>"I'm not ok. But I
           will be!"</em>. You will be <strong>OK</strong> because you are <strong><em>strong. Persevered. Loved!</em></strong>
            I may be down, but I am not out, and nor are you!</p>

          <div class="post-content">
            <p>Yesterday I had the opportunity to witness a friend achieve a great moment
             in life; receiving an award for her <em>execellence</em>. Being recognized for all
            the amazing things she has done in and around her community; changing her
            world and others for the better. </p>

            <p>I sat filled with <strong>honor</strong> witnessing her receive this award. To see a friend of
             so many years come so far, and have had moments where loss in her life has
            brought her to her knees, to see her stand <em>tall and victorious</em>, her biggest role
            model, her mother, would haven been so <strong>immensly proud</strong> of her. I know her heart wanted to
            share this moment with her. How beautiful that would have been.</p>

          <p>But there is a lesson in this. <em>We suffer loss, but we have not lost</em>.
            The <strong>perserverance</strong> to continue on when the path gets rough. To trudge
           through the deepest depths of our pains, and to conquer the mountains
          in front of us. This is the win. These are the opportunities I speak of.
          The opportunity to take our loss, and honor it with successes.</p>

          <p>Today the world seems like we are losing so much, but please remember,
          <em>We have suffered loss, but we <u><strong>haven't</strong></u> LOST!</em></p>

          <h3 class="post-title">Lead by Example</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>I was asked the other day by a friend, <em>"Mega, why are you always so positive?"</em>.
              The question was posed in a manner that suggested there was something
              wrong with my positive outlook on the world around me. I simply responded with,
              <em>"Negativity...Will it help?"</em>.</p>

            <p>Every day we face a wall of <strong>choices</strong>. The decisions we make around those
            choices presented to us, in whatever manner they are presented, determine
            the opportunites that will be afforded to us, and those we care for.</p>

            <p>Never forget, someone who looks up to you is always <u>watching.</u> Be mindful of the
            energy you exude, the words you speak, and decisions you make. It can change a life.
            Yours, or someone elses.</p>

            <p><em>Lead by example</em>. A leader isn't chosen in the words he speaks, or the price of
             his material possessions. A leader is someone who knows his actions hold weight, and
            though they may be heavy at times, he never drops them on someone else.</p>

            <p>A leaders actions are the <strong>EXAMPLE</strong> of how he molds the world around him.</p>

            <p><strong>Lead by example</strong>.</p>

          <div class="post-content">
            <p>As we wind up for the start of a new week, I want to remind you
            to remember to own your success. Think positive, and though times are
            not quite the ideal circumstance we could hope for in the world, (when is
          it ever?) we will press forward. Tell yourself:</em></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><em>I am in control of my own <strong>thinking</strong>, my own <strong>focus</strong>, my own <strong>life</strong>.</em></li>
                    <li><em>I control my own <strong>thoughts and emotions</strong> and direct the whole <u>pattern</u> of my <strong>performance, health and life</strong>.</em></li>
                    <li><em>I am fully capable of achieving the goals I set for myself today. They are within my control.</em></li>
                    <li><em>I learn from problems or setbacks and through them I see room for <strong>improvement</strong> and <strong>opportunities</strong> for personal <strong>growth</strong>.</em></li>
                    <li><em>Every day in some way I am <strong>better</strong>, wiser, more adaptable, more focused, <strong>more confident</strong>, more in control.</em></li>
                  </ul>

            <p>These positive words of affirmation, should be solidified with
              <em>"Positive actions of affirmation".</em></p>
            <p><strong>Level of Effort Equals Opportunity!!!</strong></p>

          <h3 class="post-title">Anger</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>There will be lots of things in life that affect us emotionally.
              Some will make us happy, sad, confused. Some will even excite us.
               But what about <em>'anger'?</em></p>

              <p>Anger can set us back. In the workplace it can ruin
                opportunity,  and show volatility in your ability to separate
                logic from emotion and the ability to keep a clear head while
                working with others. In relationships it can set you up to
                express feelings and speak words that can set long term
                relationships back years, or even ruin rapport between
                those you have built bridges with over time for good.</p>

              <p>Anger can <em>destroy trust and instill fear</em>, causing others to
                find you un-approachable, which in turn can place more
                obstacles in the way of achieving your goals; Hindering
                opportunity and causing others to overlook your efforts.</p>

              <p><strong>Anger</strong>. <em>Will it help?</em></p>

            <p>Here's something to ponder. How often do you take the time out
              to just <em>think?</em> Yes, we all have daily cognitive activity
              where we need to make decisions and think on trivial things.
              But how often do we take the time to be deep in thought?
              How often do we shape our minds, mold them to a sharper focus?</p>

          <div class="post-content">
            <p>There will be moments where you just need to listen to the
              people, and the world around you. No words need to be spoken.
              Every question doesn't warrant an answer. Every statement
              doesn't need to be taken as some poignant moment, or even
              something you need to spend energy contemplating.</p>

              <p>Silence doesn't mean you don't care. Sometimes,
                <em><strong>silence is silence</strong></em>...It is all you have to give in that moment.</p>

          <div class="post-content">
            <p>Afraid of <em>Change?</em> For some that word, even the thought of it is
              scary. Small change. Big changes. Often life can throw a lot of
              reasons for change your way. Some good. Some bad.
            </p>

              <p>Change can be scary. It doesnt just affect you, but may affect
                loved ones. Affects your normal day to day. What was yesterday,
                is and will be different today and tomorrow. You are afraid. Unsure.
                That is understood.</p>

              <p>There have been times in my life I have had to accept change,
                and I was afraid. <em><strong>Afraid…But I will succeed!</strong></em> I will never allow
                 change to derail goals I have set, and opportunity I have
                 worked so hard for. I have learned to <u>trust</u> myself. My
                 foundation. My strength and will to press forward even in
                 tough times.</p>

              <p>In order to accept change you must understand it. In order
                to understand it, like anything else, you must be patient and
                learn. <em>Change your mind, it can change your life.</em></p>

              <p>Change is good. I know you are afraid...<strong>But you will Succeed!</strong></p>

          <h3 class="post-title">Financial Literacy</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>Stop wondering where your money went. Why you are <em>"broke"</em> all the
              time, or how to finance a car, home, or your education.
              Many of these woes stem from not understanding how to properly
              <strong>manage</strong> money,  and lack of <u>self discipline</u> when it comes to
              attaining, spending, and tracking your finances.
            </p>

              <p>Inadequate or lack of <strong>financial literacy</strong> can lead to a
                lifetime of debt related issues that can create serious
                issues in relationships, ability to live a healthy life
                socially, and even cause emotional issues leading to
                depression, anger, and in very very serious cases…well
                you get the picture.</p>

              <p>Take control of your <em>"ignorance"</em> around money and what it
                really should mean to you, and what you really should be
                doing with it. It is vital to living in a capital driven world.</p>

              <p>Read. Study. <strong>Don't be financially illiterate</strong>.  It can destroy
                your path to success.</p>

          <div class="post-content">
            <p><strong>Fighting it. Fighting it some more.</strong> Throw in a few obstacles
              here, a few obstacles there. One excuse, two excuses. Yea that
              sounds about right. It's <em>Monday</em>, you've been putting off starting
              a new project in your life for a long time now. Days, weeks…Years!
            </p>

              <p>I get it. You're at the toughest part of the process…<em>Starting</em>.
                I mean, we all have been there. We make so many excuses as to why
                we haven't gotten things into gear, and started working on being
                the best version of ourselves we could possibly be. Every day
                feels like a struggle to kickstart the right attitude, and
                muster up the necessary energy to be great.</p>

              <p>But here is the thing. It gets easier. The tough part is
                starting. So put the <strong>scapegoats</strong> down. Step away from the
                excuses, and champion the "<u><em>you know what up!</em></u>" The <em>"hard"</em> part in
                the process of starting a new journey, or taking on a new
                challenge is putting down the weight of mediocrity you've
                been holding onto because its seems easier. Seems normal.
                It's not. It's bad for your health.  Let it go.</p>

              <p><strong>Step up and stand out for you</strong>. Then you can make this
                success thing look easy!</p>

          <div class="post-content">
            <p>It's not the number of books you've read, social media <em>"friends"</em>
              you have, or times you've done one thing versus another. <strong>Quantity</strong>
              only matters when it is in respect to number of opportunities
              created or available,  people you've touched in a positive way,
              or solutions to problems. Even that is dependent on one
              thing. <strong>Quality</strong>.
            </p>

              <p>It is the quality of the books you read that builds the mind.
                I'd rather have one friend I know I can depend on when it
                counts the most, than a long list of unknowns to fill a
                space on social media to <em>"feel better"</em> about myself. I would
                rather take the time to do a great job at something once to
                do it right, and potentially never have to do it again, than
                to have to repeat the process over and over to patch the lack

          <h3 class="post-title">What. When. How.</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p><strong><em>What</em></strong> often occurs in relationships are disagreements. Arguments.
              Some trivial,  some more serious. But inevitably they will happen,
              and you must have the proper tools to deal with them.
            </p>

              <p><strong><em>When</em></strong> dicord happens, could be over words said,
                Actions that threaten the health of the relationship, or most
                common, a misunderstanding and or a miscommunication that
                takes a small flame of <em>"upset"</em> and fans it to full blown
                anger and all out war against one another.</p>

                <p>I'm sure we've all experienced something, felt we had the
                  right tools, and attempted to employ them to solve a problem.
                  Maybe they helped. Maybe they didn't. But I surely can say
                  in my experience, there have been times when I totally have
                  been confused about what the disagreement was about, how we even
                  got to that juncture, attempted to solve the problem logically,
                  and defuse the situation only to make it worse. Possibly because
                  of my own ignorance of the issue, or maybe something I didn't
                  see in myself or other person that could have lead to
                  an easier, quicker, and more amicable solution.</p>

                <p><em>"<strong><em>How</em></strong> do we solve these problems Mega?"</em> You ask. The answer to
                  that question is <em>"I don't know!"</em> I can't solve every problem,
                  and in a relationship, I surely <strong>cannot</strong> solve them all on
                  my own. What I think is important to start with is good
                  communication on all sides. Honesty and openness without
                  judgment or finger pointing. But most importantly, and I think
                  many, many people forget this, is to understand when you are
                  in a relationship <em>(Friendship, romantic, professional)</em>, and you have a disagreement, remember that it
                  is <strong><u>you and the other person against the problem, not you against each other</u></strong>.</p>

          <h3 class="post-title">Re-Couping Lost Time</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>There are going to be days where we have done nothing toward
              achieving set goals. Situations that alter our paths and
              affect milestones. <em>Life happens</em>.
            </p>

              <p>But how do we re-coup that lost time? How do we regain control
                of our time table? <strong>Proper time management and level setting</strong>.
                That's how.</p>

                <p>Taking the time out to review our schedules, and re-work
                  daily tasks is a great way to make up for lost time.
                  Setting expectations with yourself, and others allows
                  for you to get back on track, and back to setting your
                  efforts toward building and grasping a hold of new opportunities.</p>

                <p>Remember, the <strong>"4 P's"</strong>: <em>"Preparation Prevents
                   Poor Performance!"</em></p>

          <div class="post-content">
            <p><strong>Problem is…</strong>You have bad habits. We often get into the habit of
              wanting this, wanting that, and then jumping face first into a
              poorly planned (<em>or no plan</em>) project, process or idea. So what
              happens? We give up. Which translates to Failure.
            </p>

              <p>Don't let others excitement about something be your <em>'hype man'</em>
                to <strong>failure</strong>. Setting yourself up for disappointment and wasted
                time also leads to killing your motivation and progress toward
                properly set goals. Zaps energy.</p>

                <p>Take the time to do your due diligence and research. Pad your
                  goals with real viable knowledge of whatever it is you are
                  doing. The more you know, the easier path to success. The
                  more effort you put into building understanding, proper
                  time and resource management, the more <strong><em>opportunity to succeed
                  and grow</em></strong>.</p>

                <p>Turn your habits into action that translates to
                  positive renumeration/return on invested time and energy.
                Procrastination, and scapegoats will never reward you. Efforts will. </p>

            <p>Someone woke up today with yesterday's weight of <em>their</em> world on
              their shoulders. This weight can be from many things; unresolved
              conflicts with friends and family, the loss of a loved one, the
              current state of the world we are living in today, or
              things that are not being dealt with within self. There is, and
              always will be something.
            </p>

              <p>Today I'm not going to tell you to <em>suck it up, get over it,
                be strong and move on</em>. I'm not going to tell you that these
                are just challenges that are hindering you from achieving goals
                set for success. All this may be true. But that is not what
                today's message is about.</p>

                <p>Today, I want you to know, <strong>IT WILL BE ALRIGHT!</strong> Yesterday was
                  tough. Today seems tougher. Tomorrow may even bring more of
                  the same. Lean on those who love you. Who you trust. If today

              <p>Don't forget to <em>breathe</em>. To see the majority of the world is

          <h3 class="post-title">Un-realistic Expectations</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>When we talk about <em>level setting</em>,  and managing expectations,
              most of the time we are tuning the mind to <em>reality</em>. Thing is, we
              often have <strong><em>great</em></strong> expectations of people,
              places, and situations.
            </p>

              <p>Being able to step down off of cloud nine and see a situation
                for what it truly is, and what it could be with the proper
                efforts,  helps us to set realistic expectations for our
                <em>relationships, workplace, and goals</em>. Not having the
                right tools, or even the right mind set, can set you up to
                fail trying to achieve success with <strong>unrealistic expectations</strong>
                of self.</p>

                <p>Always know your worth. Believing you deserve an opportunity
                  because you <em>"feel"</em> you have a talent or some entitlement
                  doesn't mean you can expect the same sentiment from others.
                  Sometimes setting  your <em>pride</em> and
                  <em>ego</em> to the side, looking at your true abilities,  then
                  setting goals properly, will sway you from unrealistic
                  expectations.</p>

                <p>You can <u>always</u> grow and add new tools to your toolbox.
                  That should <u>always</u> be a <strong>Realistic Expectation</strong>.</p>

          <div class="post-content">
            <p>You've worked hard. You've put forth a lot of effort to open new doors to new opportunity. 
              Then the opportunity presents itself and boom, you doubt if it's for you.
            </p>

              <p>Now there may be a few underlying issues or reasons you have some doubts.  Maybe you 
                feel you will be burning a bridge. Maybe you believe that you are not ready for the success 
                train to take you where you want to be. Leary of taking that step forward and through that door 
                because you've <em>"failed"</em> in the past. Whatever it is, <strong><em>the burden of self doubt is heavy</em></strong>.</p>

                <p>Self doubt is a nasty counter tool many use in their day to day lives to boost their 
                  confidence in the <strong>excuses and scapegoats</strong> they have made to not leap forward. Leaping can be scary. 
                  <strong>Don't ever doubt your ability</strong>. You've put in the work, and you've taken the time to get this far by 
                  being everything you needed to be, one of those things is <em>strong</em>.</p> 
                  
                  <p><strong>Don't let self doubt be the obstacle that derails your run to success.</strong></p>

          <h3 class="post-title">Patience</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>Sometimes we find ourselves exasperated. Things, people,
              stressful or unexpected situations test the limits of what
              we are willing to deal with throughout our days. Of course
              we learn to overcome these things over time, and find ways
              to move forward. But the key to successfully navigating
              these issues is <em>patience</em>.
            </p>

              <p>The term <strong><em>"Patience is a virtue"</em></strong> rings very true and is not at
                all a virtue that everyone is graced with. With the growing
                need for instant gratification, social acceptance, and yes
                very much a factor; spoiled brats, patience nowadays can be
                hard to come by. But nonetheless, can be <strong>learned</strong>.</p>

                <p>Take the time to breathe.  Recognize situations before they
                  develop into moments that can agitate your progress during
                  your day. Step away and think through these situations with
                  <u>logic</u>, separating your emotions.  Taking the time to do this
                  can lead to great progress in learning patience, and building
                  rapport with those around you. More often than not, people
                  are not intentionally trying to make you lose patience,
                  sometimes they just dont know.</p>

                <p><em>Take a breath. Think it through.  Be patient.</em></p>

          <div class="post-content">
            <p>Yesterday I asked a group of people a question. Though the words
              of this question were simple in the sense that the words were
              not long, complex and hard to pronounce, but the question itself
              had a deeper, more complex focus. Very much out of the realm of simple.
            </p>

              <p><strong>Question:</strong> <em>"What is the worst part about being a man/woman?"</em></p>

                <p>Some were unable to think deeper than the surface of
                  materialistic things, and some couldn't answer the question
                  at all because they <em>lost it in translation</em>. Giving answers
                  like, <em>"I love being a man/woman"</em> or <em>"men are assholes"</em>. Of
                  course this was a response from a woman's perspective that
                  had nothing to do with the question posed.</p>

                <p>This draws a <strong>simple</strong>, yet <em>interesting observation</em>;
                  All too often things are <em>lost in translation</em>. Either
                  because of lack of listening or unwillingness to, or
                  lack of <strong>comprehension and understanding</strong>. Don't lose focus
                  on important things in life <em>"tracking down problems for a
                  solution"</em> or wasting too much time on the trivial things.
                  Dont allow emotion to cloud judgment and cost you opportunity.</p>

                  <p><strong>Answer the questions asked to you</strong>. The only way to do that
                    is to start listening, be sure you understand. Process and
                    respond, or your <u>opportunities for success</u> will be <em>lost in
                    translation</em> as well.</p>

          <div class="post-content">
            <p><em>"How was your day?"</em> So many of us underestimate the meaning and
              value of this question. Day after day, week after week, some are
              living for the start of the weekend instead of living in the moment
              they are in; Wasting time and energy resenting their current situations.
            </p>

              <p>So, how was your day? Truly think about it. What did you
                accomplish? What went undone? Forgotten? Did you have any <em>wins
                or losses?</em> All of these questions can add <strong>tremendous value</strong> to how
                you start and end the next day and so on.</p>

                <p>Make a conscious effort to dig into the events of your day.
                  Dont just follow a calendar schedule because it is there.
                  What meaning does it hold? Peel back the layers of time you
                  are spending on menial tasks or activities and recognize
                  if they add value, or are hindering you from success.</p>

                <p>If you are looking to be productive and achieve set goals,
                  you have to ask <strong><em>"How was your day?"</em></strong>, and if the answers you
                  find lack real reason to continue along a path, make the
                   necessary adjustments so the next day isn't the same.</p>

              <p>In order to truly solve a problem we must first <u><em>identify</em></u> the
                root cause. Often enough we have clouded our head space with
                so many <em>scapegoats, excuses and procrastinations</em>, we can't
                see clear to the founding cause of our issues. Identifying
                the root cause takes a lot of <strong>self reflecting</strong>, lowering of
                pride, ego, and riddance of excuses. Finding a true resolution
                takes real guts, and self courage to accept that your flaws and
                or bad habits may be the reason you have not been able to
                properly deal with recurring issues in your life.</p>

                <p>Take a step back. Look deep within to identify. Swallow your
                  pride and crack the foundation of these things holding you
                  back from success. Looking for a quick fix will only have you
                  bouncing from one moment of mediocrity to the next. Think
                  <strong>long term</strong>, and you will have <em>true resolutions</em>, <u>lasting
                  success</u> and <strong>OPPORTUNITY</strong>.</p>

          <h3 class="post-title">Watch Your Tone</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>The way you speak to others influences their interactions with you.
              <strong>Language generates energy</strong>.  In an already hostile situation,
              choosing the right words will, not can, but will determine
              the outcome of that interaction. In a moment where encouragment is
              needed, the right words can change a path. A decision. A <strong><em>life</em></strong>.
            </p>

              <p>Do not give <em>power</em> to negative energy. Adding fuel to a fire
                when water is needed can lead to others seeing you as an
                <strong>instigator</strong>.  <em>Improper communication</em> is just as bad, and sometimes
                worse than <u>no communication.</u></p>

                <p>Watching your tone, and choosing to level your frustrations
                  before speaking can afford you many opportunities to lead
                  others to cooler heads. In doing so, this can propel you into
                  leadership positions in the workplace.  This can inspire <strong>trust</strong>
                  among friends and family, and most importantly, makes you
                  <em>approachable</em>. You cannot have opportunity if you are not approachable.</p>

                <p><strong><em>Watch your tone</em></strong>. You never know what kind of reverb
                  too much bass can cause.</p>

          <div class="post-content">
            <p>You're staring at a mountain of a task in front of you. You've
              had a bad week. Month. Maybe even a bad year. Mentally exhausted.
              There is so much going on,  you can't seem get enough done in the
              day to even begin to start up the path of this new challenege.
            </p>

              <p>You know the saying <em>"In order to be the man, you've got to
                beat the man"</em> (Or woman)? Well sometimes that man/woman is you.
                Sometimes you are <em>beating yourself so good</em>, it's <strong>bad</strong>. Those who
                are willing to step up to new challenges always have that <strong><em>"gut check"</em></strong>
                moment. The moment where the feet meet the road, and the hands are
                ready to get dirty.</p>

                <p>But when do we have the guts to say it's ok to take a step
                  back and settle ourselves enough to live? Dare to find peace
                  for ourselves instead of exhausting all of our efforts to
                  succeed for someone else?
                </p>

                <p>Know when to have that gut check moment to step up and tackle
                  challenges.  But remember to have the guts to step aside when
                  you need to <em>revive</em> <strong><em>SELF</em></strong>.</p>

            <p>The past couple of days have been tough. Maybe you've been dealing
              with some personal issues, or your professional life isn't as
              uplifting and attractive as you'd like it to be. Maybe everything
              is the total opposite of that. <em>Life is great!</em> At home things are
              flowing smoothly. In the office you are a fine tuned mastermind.
              So much so that you have gotten into a groove, and now there are some
              things you just <strong>don't want to do</strong>.
            </p>

              <p>Sometimes in life there is so much going on, or lack thereof,
                you may start to feel like you dont want to do some of the daily

                things that help supplement your success and continue to build

                <p>When you start to get a case of the <em>"I don't want to's"</em>
                  remember to tell yourself, <em>I don't want to fail. I don't want

          <div class="post-content">
            <p><strong><em>Consequence</em></strong>. What is it? When we take a moment and think  about
              the choices we make in life, who it affects, what opportunities
              it leads to, or doors it closes, we can begin to see the real power of choices.
            </p>

              <p>The term <em>"choose wisely"</em> holds so much weight, that in moments of
                haste we can forget that making a choice can be life altering,
                and in some cases; life ending. Our actions affect our families,
                relationships, careers, and societies view of who we are and
                what we can contribute to our communities.</p>

                <p>Be mindful of your choices. That includes the <em>friends you keep,
                  foods you eat, words you speak, and time you spend in places</em>.
                  Make choices that empower you to not only strive for excellence,
                  but adds value to your life and others. Choose to exude the right energy
                  for progression and building lasting, positive rapport with those around you.
                </p>

                <p>So what is <em>consequence</em>? Well that depends on the <strong><em>CHOICES</em></strong> you make.</p>

          <div class="post-content">
            <p>Stop expecting success through osmosis.  In life, <strong>you get what you
              give</strong>. If you give off negative energy, or an <em>'I can't'</em> attitude;
              that's what you will get in return. If you never compromise, or
              try to see the world from a <strong>different point of view</strong>, others won't
              do the same for you.
            </p>

              <p>Take a moment to step away from everything you want, and think
                about the level of effort you put in to achieve the goals you
                should be setting to accomplish those things. Think about the amount
                of time you are putting into training your mind. <em>Is it quality time?</em>
                In that time, is it <strong>100%</strong> of your effort? Or is it filled with
                <em>procrastination, scapegoats and excuses?</em>
                An hour isn't just an hour when there is lots to be done.
                An hour can be wasted, or in an hour, you can be super productive
                and do two hours of work.</p>

                <p>You get what you give.  No matter if you are on the job,
                  building a business, working on a relationship, or raising a
                  child. <u>You get out, what you put into it.</u>
                </p>

                <p><strong><em>You get what you give</em></strong>. Make sure you are giving
                  positive energy, <strong>QUALITY</strong> effort and time..</p>

          <h3 class="post-title">Communication</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>What makes an effective leader? What moves people to follow and
              believe in the path being created by others before them? Some
              will say <strong>FAITH</strong>. <strong>TRUST</strong>. <strong>HOPE</strong>.
            </p>

              <p>I say <em>communication</em>.</p>

                <p>To be a great leader, yes you have to inspire. You have to
                  have a knack for asking why, and when that why is asked, you
                  have to be able to provide the how. Providing that <em>"how"</em> is
                  the hard part. Being able to communicate a message, goal,
                  plan or even your feelings/emotions clearly and concisely
                  will help others to not only trust, but to understand.</p>

                <p>But the most useful and effective tool a good communicator
                  can employ is knowing when, and how to </strong>LISTEN</strong>. I believe
                  listening is the foundation of communication. <u>Listening to
                  understand.</u> To gain <Mem>insight and knowledge</em>. Listening to share.
                  Share in the opening of pathways you have not yet traveled.</p>

                <p><strong><strong>Communication</strong>. Don't lack it!</strong></p>

          <div class="post-content">
            <p>Think of the many meals you've eaten throughout your life.
              I bet you can think of some yummy lunches, dinners, and late night
              snacks! I know I can. But the most important meal of the day is <em>breakfast!</em>
            </p>

              <p>How you start your day is super important. It sets the tone
                for your mood, energy, and cognitive ability as you get your
                day going. So, in the first meals we consume in life; you know,
                the books we read, the classes/lessons we take and the
                experiences and people we encounter; Why would we not finish that meal?
              </p>

                <p>Too often we are forgetting the <strong>foundation</strong>. The spring time
                  of our lives is important. Learn as much as you can. Consume
                  the good meals fed to you through not only <u>YOUR</u> experiences,
                  but the <em>knowledge and experience</em> of <u>OTHERS</u>. Give yourself an

          <h3 class="post-title">Passion & Sacrifice</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>So very often I am asked by the people I meet and have the
              privilege of being part of their journey to success, hearing and
              knowing their stories, and offering guidance or unbiased opinion,
              <em>"How do I know what it is I am to be doing in life?"</em>.
            </p>

              <p>My response is simple: Find what you are passionate about.
                What you are willing to <strong>sacrifice time, energy, sleep, and
                some of your deepest desires</strong> for. That is what you should
                be doing in life. Life is a <em>multi-variate</em> time series; Not
                everything will fall into place at once. There are so many
                variables in life that are different for each of us. Some of
                us grew up <em>"with"</em>, some <em>"without"</em>. Whatever that with/without is,
                it has helped mold you into who you are today. Some of that is
                positive. Some not so positive.
              </p>

                <p>Collect the variables in your life that are holding you back.
                  <strong>Throw them away!</strong> If you have to force yourself to do
                  something,  you truly aren't passionate about it, and
                  you surely won't sacrifice for it when challenging times
                  arise. The things that <em>elevate your thinking, increase
                  your positivity, and energize</em> you to go harder toward your
                  goals, those are the things to hold onto.
                </p>

                <p>Ask yourself what your passions are. Insert the variables
                  in life you would have to sacrifice to get to that passion.
                  If you are willing,  then the answer is already in front of you.

          <div class="post-content">
            <p>Ever find yourself not making any progress? You've been attacking
              something for years, and you always seem to drop the ball on it
              and say you'll pick it up at a <em>'later date'</em> ? Yea, sounds like procrastination;
              And procrastination does have extremities.
            </p>

              <p>Procrastinating doesn't necessarily mean you aren't a motivated
                person, or incapable. Sometimes it just means damnit, you are

                some internal fear of failure, self doubt, or someone won't like it. Or
                something silly and trivial, yet it's holding your progress hostage.

                  face and be <strong>100%</strong> honest. Others will tell you what you want
                  to hear. Some will tip toe around the truth and tell you
                  little white lies to pamper your feelings. You need to
                  remove the filter and give yourself a <em>(insert expletive of
                  your choice people)</em> pep talk and step up so you can stand out.

                  <strong>emotions set you in motion.</strong></p>

          <div class="post-content">
            <p>When you set great expectations of yourself with others, and
              they believe they will get the best from you, <em>FOLLOW THROUGH!</em>
              Always show up to opportunity dressed from the inside out for success.
            </p>

              <p>What does that mean? That means you need to be confident, ready
                to teach, and just as important, ready to listen, learn and
                understand. The effort put in to get the opportunities afforded
                you are just the beginning. Following through and seeing things
                to completion are what builds <strong>bridges of trust</strong> to even more
                opportunity and success.
              </p>

                <p>In relationships following through with good communication
                  and patience. In the workplace,  with meeting deadlines and
                  doing well and completing tasks assigned to you. In life with
                  adding tools to your toolbox and applying what you've learned.
                  Knowing when to <em>"step up and stand out"</em>, and always doing your
                  best to never break promises.

                </p>

                <p><strong>Follow through.</strong> What you put out, can always use you

            <p>You just accomplished a goal. Got a big promotion, graduated,
              bought that first car, <strong>GOT THAT NEW JOB</strong>, or even started doing something you've
              always wanted to do. Do you remember the moment? Do you feel it?
              The joy? The elation?
            </p>

              <p><em>Revel in it!</em> Take the time to really capture every bit of it.
                Let it take your breathe away, and be a constant reminder of
                why you strive for excellence. Why you put in the long hours,
                and hard work. Revel in the power of you, and your tenacious
                grit to be the best version of you.
              </p>

                <p>All too often our joy's are short lived. The luster of it
                  all is like a rug swept right from under our feet. Most of
                  the time we are killing our own joy. So when you accomplish
                  something, big, small. Whatever; Revel in that moment. Use
                  its energy to move you. Revel in knowing <em>"you did that"!</em>

            <p>What you do in life every day from the time you are capable of
              controlling your actions, and make your own decisions to this
              very moment is called <em>insurance</em>. This insurance provides you the
              ability to hedge bets against your success, and if you fall a little
              short sometimes, the foundation of <strong>hard work and effort</strong>
              you have
              put in over time should and will still afford you new opportunities.
            </p>

              <p>Be mindful of the foundation you are building. The choices you
                are making, the books you read, the people you allow in your
                circle. All of these things contribute to your success or lack
                of. All of these things are a part of your life's insurance plan.
              </p>

                <p>In your life, keep your eyes on the right things that make
                  you happy. <strong>Energize</strong> yourself with the right people that have
                  your <em>goals and success</em> in mind, and know when to <em><u>respectfully</u></em> 
                  help set you back on the right path when needed.

          <div class="post-content">
            <p><em>"I can't".</em>  <em>"I'm not confident with"</em>…Two phrases that I believe
              hold many people from achieving certain goals, and losing out on
              the opportunity to take hold of the wheel in driving along the
              path to their success.
            </p>

              <p><em><strong>Own your success!</strong></em> There are many roadblocks
                and people along
                the way to your greatness that will do many things, and put
                you in many situations for potential failure. Don't be one of
                those roadblocks.  Building self awareness, confidence and
                trust will help propel you past these obstacles and reward
                you in more ways than one.
              </p>

                <p>Owning your success doesnt mean you know everything.
                  Doesn't mean you refuse to ask for help. Doesn't mean you
                  have to do everything alone. It is quite frankly, the opposite.
                  Owning your success means you know when to get a second opinion,
                  pick up a book to learn something new, or enlist the wisdom of
                  others to impart on you new knowledge that can help in
                  sculpting a better version of you.
                </p>

                <p>Owning your success means holding yourself and others
                  that are a part of your journey <em>accountable.</em>
                </p>

                <p>Do that, and surely you can be confident you will <strong>SUCCEED.</strong>

          <div class="post-content">
            <p>There are many people who struggle day to day to find the
              motivation to live life to the fullest. Some struggle with <em>money,
              time management, patience</em>, and often many struggles are caused
              by <em>mental & physical</em> health challenges.

                <p>What you love, how you love, and most importantly, who you

                <p>Remember,  no matter how long the journey or dark the tunnel,

          <div class="post-content">
            <p>Someone told me in an interesting discussion, they feel like life
              is a series of problems or challenges with rainbow sprinkles on top.
              Of course those sprinkles being the happy moments in life we should
              take time to cherish and appreciate.
            </p>

              <p>I usually do not agree with this sentiment,  but as we dug deeper,
                I realized yes. Yes there are more challenges at times than there
                are the existential <em>rainbow sprinkles</em>, and our society has
                morphed into an Orwell like 1984, where everyone around us is
                controlled by the number of followers they have or some new
                cosmetic alteration they can pull off or put onto their bodies.
                Roaming around like programmed drones to do one thing; what
                they are told.

                <p>Breaking away from this day to day droll, or giving up on playing
                  the fool
                  can help eliminate lots of the challenges we face. Better
                  communication, removing the social media constructs, and having a
                  desire to be human Instead of a programmable android; <strong>This is

            <p>Don't go your entire life living your days only to please others.
              Don't waste the time complaining about the trivial things that
              don't add up to even a minutes worth of real energy. Life has so
              many ups and downs, so many obstacles that will try to derail your

                <p>I remember when I lost sight of the real reasons I do what I
                  do every day of my life; <em><strong>NEVER</strong></em>. I may
                  have a bad day. I may
                  even want to be alone for a while, but I never lose the desire
                  to live and be free. I never forget there are many less
                  fortunate people in this world who give <strong>100%</strong> of themselves
                  to live, so why can't I. Why can't you?

            <p>Life is made up of many things all lumped into 3 major categories,

          <h3 class="post-title">Constructive vs. Destructive criticism</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>Have you ever given someone feedback on something they were a part
              of? Or maybe you were the recipient of the feedback or the tail
              end of an expressed opinion. How did it feel?
            </p>

              <p>There are times where we will need to express our opinions or
                provide feedback to others on their performance in many situations
                in life. But the only way to be an <em>effective communicator</em> is to
                understand the difference between <strong>constructive</strong>
                and <strong>destructive</strong>
                criticism. Often enough these two forms of critique are confused
                and mis-used.
              </p>

                <p><em>Constructive criticism</em> provides pathways to learning and
                  understanding of how one can turn weaknesses into strengths.
                  Allows for growth, and let's a person walk away feeling
                  confident they can solve a problem with real solutions with
                  the right support and tuning of their efforts.
                </p>

                <p><em>Destructive criticism</em> is the exact opposite. It's draining,
                  often de-moralizing and de-motivating. Always remember,
                  <strong>blowing out someone else's candles won't make yours brighter!</strong>
                  Help build bridges to learning,  not walls to block progress.

          <h3 class="post-title">The Un-appreciated Value</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>Have you ever felt like the <em>Unappreciated</em> value in a relationship,
              Romantic, platonic or otherwise? You say, <em>"well what do you mean
              by that Mega?"</em> What I mean is have you ever been the <em>"Appreciative
              value"</em> for someone? You add value to their lives. You show up like
              a friend should. You love them how they want and need to be loved.
              You give. You compromise. You give some more. Yet you feel all of
              that goes unnoticed, and you feel all of your efforts go un-reciprocated.
              Not that you do those things for the recognition or anything in
              return, but some positive affirmations would be nice.</p>

              <p>I was asked how I handle those feelings. Those times where I
                feel like I am giving so much, and still feeling like the value
                I add and efforts I put in to help lift others up goes unappreciated.
                I feel used. At work. At home. In the world. No one wants to feel used. </p>

                <p>My answer to that is simple. Control what you can. <strong>YOU</strong>.
                  Sometimes you have to love, but give a little less. Know the
                  level of rapport you have with someone. Know the level of
                  selfish you are willing to accept from others. Know your limits
                  on what you are willing to let go unnoticed, even if it's just
                  a few words of positive affirmation from others. Know how to
                  say <strong>'No'</strong> if those you care for are not willing to step up and
                  be an <em>'Appreciative Asset'</em> in your life. Relationships on any
                  level are a give and take. But on all levels, the giving should
                  be <strong>equal in effort!!</strong></p>

          <div class="post-content">
            <p>The going…what is it? The going is the "path" to your goals.
              And guess what? Sometimes the going gets tough! But you've got to
              keep pushing, putting in the effort to get those opportunities for
              success.  </p>

              <p>The Going gets tough,  and sometimes we feel like we want to
                give in to the negative thoughts, or the fears and scapegoats.
                But DON'T! You've got to go through what you are going through.
                In order to get to that goal, you've got to go down that path.</p>

                <p>There will be times where that path is nice and smooth, sunny
                  and bright. But when that path gets rough and rocky, tough on
                  your motivation, and dark as hell, you got to keep going. </p>

          <div class="post-content">
            <p>Every day you have so much to do. At home you do your best to keep
              your house in order. In the office, you have loads of work to do.
              In life, you have so many people you feel you need to please. </p>

              <p><em>Stop!</em> Do what matters.</p>

                <p>It takes time, but spend the time to organize the realistic
                  goals in your day to day life. Take the time to breathe a
                  little, don't have this senseless thought that the <em>"constant
                  grind"</em> and tireless work is the way to success. Hard work yes,
                  is the correct path to success, but proper rest and mental
                  reprieve are just as important.</p>

          <h3 class="post-title">Appreciative Value</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p><em>Time. Money. Education.</em> These are all things we consider to have an
              appreciative value in our lives. <strong>Time</strong> allows us to experience more,
              maybe rush less or enjoy things to their capacity. Coupled with <strong>money</strong>,
              the experiences can be even greater. <strong>Education</strong> allows us to learn
              and apply new skills and possibly even share in something that
              affects positive change. Sure these things can depreciate in value,
              but managed properly, they should add great value to your life. </p>

            <p>But what about people? I had an interesting discussion the other day,
              and I realized some people have forgotten the appreciative value of
              human connection. Sharing and understanding. Some are either too
              stubborn, arrogant, jaded or maybe even too full of themselves to
              realize the great value add of the people in front of them, and
              the relationships they should work to foster and manage positively. </p>

              <p>Open your mind. Ask yourself <em>"Am I an appreciating asset in the
                lives of others around me?"</em> If the answer is truly yes, good on you.
                But if the answer is no, ask yourself <em>"why?"</em>. Could it be your
                attitude? The way you respond to people? Are you a rain cloud on
                a sunny day? Do you make others feel like you don't care?
                Is everything about you? </p>

              <p>Don't be the stock no one wants to buy. The depreciating asset.</p>

              <p>I appreciate your time…</p>

      <h3 class="post-title">Accepting Change</h3>
      <div class="post-content">
        <p>As humans we are creatures of habit. We have tendencies to repeat
          things over and over knowing these actions yes can result in positves/successes,
          but more often than not, these habits lead to failures, pain, loss
          (opportunity, time, relationships), and even freedom.</p>

          <p>When we are unsure, or feel as if we are losing control, we run to a place of
            comfort. Think of it like a child with a teddy bear or a blanket.
            Often psychologically, we trick ourselves into believing what we are doing is
            the safest thing for us. We are naturally opposed to change.</p>

            <p>Learning to accept change, and seeing the outlook of others as opportunities
              to learn, can not only inspire growth within self, but can and will expand
              knowledge, build positive rapport, and show that you are flexible and open minded.</p>

              <p>Being able to see past your own agendas, and work toward a collective agenda
                for success, very much requires the ability to <strong>ACCEPT  CHANGE.</strong></p>
