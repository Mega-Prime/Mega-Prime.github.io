          <h3 class="post-title">The Un-appreciated Value</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>Have you ever felt like the <em>Unappreciated</em> value in a relationship,
              Romantic, platonic or otherwise? You say, <em>"well what do you mean
              by that Mega?"</em> What I mean is have you ever been the <em>"Appreciative
              value"</em> for someone? You add value to their lives. You show up like
              a friend should. You love them how they want and need to be loved.
              You give. You compromise. You give some more. Yet you feel all of
              that goes unnoticed, and you feel all of your efforts go un-reciprocated.
              Not that you do those things for the recognition or anything in
              return, but some positive affirmations would be nice.</p>

              <p>I was asked how I handle those feelings. Those times where I
                feel like I am giving so much, and still feeling like the value
                I add and efforts I put in to help lift others up goes unappreciated.
                I feel used. At work. At home. In the world. No one wants to feel used. </p>

                <p>My answer to that is simple. Control what you can. <strong>YOU</strong>.
                  Sometimes you have to love, but give a little less. Know the
                  level of rapport you have with someone. Know the level of
                  selfish you are willing to accept from others. Know your limits
                  on what you are willing to let go unnoticed, even if it's just
                  a few words of positive affirmation from others. Know how to
                  say <strong>'No'</strong> if those you care for are not willing to step up and
                  be an <em>'Appreciative Asset'</em> in your life. Relationships on any
                  level are a give and take. But on all levels, the giving should
                  be <strong>equal in effort!!</strong></p>

          <h3 class="post-title">The Going...</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>The going…what is it? The going is the "path" to your goals.
              And guess what? Sometimes the going gets tough! But you've got to
              keep pushing, putting in the effort to get those opportunities for
              success.  </p>

              <p>The Going gets tough,  and sometimes we feel like we want to
                give in to the negative thoughts, or the fears and scapegoats.
                But DON'T! You've got to go through what you are going through.
                In order to get to that goal, you've got to go down that path.</p>

                <p>There will be times where that path is nice and smooth, sunny
                  and bright. But when that path gets rough and rocky, tough on
                  your motivation, and dark as hell, you got to keep going. </p>

                  <p><strong>The going gets tough…but you are tougher!</strong></p>

          <h3 class="post-title">Do What Matters</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>Every day you have so much to do. At home you do your best to keep
              your house in order. In the office, you have loads of work to do.
              In life, you have so many people you feel you need to please. </p>

              <p><em>Stop!</em> Do what matters.</p>

                <p>It takes time, but spend the time to organize the realistic
                  goals in your day to day life. Take the time to breathe a
                  little, don't have this senseless thought that the <em>"constant
                  grind"</em> and tireless work is the way to success. Hard work yes,
                  is the correct path to success, but proper rest and mental
                  reprieve are just as important.</p>

          <h3 class="post-title">Appreciative Value</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p><em>Time. Money. Education.</em> These are all things we consider to have an
              appreciative value in our lives. <strong>Time</strong> allows us to experience more,
              maybe rush less or enjoy things to their capacity. Coupled with <strong>money</strong>,
              the experiences can be even greater. <strong>Education</strong> allows us to learn
              and apply new skills and possibly even share in something that
              affects positive change. Sure these things can depreciate in value,
              but managed properly, they should add great value to your life. </p>

            <p>But what about people? I had an interesting discussion the other day,
              and I realized some people have forgotten the appreciative value of
              human connection. Sharing and understanding. Some are either too
              stubborn, arrogant, jaded or maybe even too full of themselves to
              realize the great value add of the people in front of them, and
              the relationships they should work to foster and manage positively. </p>

              <p>Open your mind. Ask yourself <em>"Am I an appreciating asset in the
                lives of others around me?"</em> If the answer is truly yes, good on you.
                But if the answer is no, ask yourself <em>"why?"</em>. Could it be your
                attitude? The way you respond to people? Are you a rain cloud on
                a sunny day? Do you make others feel like you don't care?
                Is everything about you? </p>

              <p>Don't be the stock no one wants to buy. The depreciating asset.</p>

              <p>I appreciate your time…</p>

      <h3 class="post-title">Accepting Change</h3>
      <div class="post-content">
        <p>As humans we are creatures of habit. We have tendencies to repeat
          things over and over knowing these actions yes can result in positves/successes,
          but more often than not, these habits lead to failures, pain, loss
          (opportunity, time, relationships), and even freedom.</p>

          <p>When we are unsure, or feel as if we are losing control, we run to a place of
            comfort. Think of it like a child with a teddy bear or a blanket.
            Often psychologically, we trick ourselves into believing what we are doing is
            the safest thing for us. We are naturally opposed to change.</p>

            <p>Learning to accept change, and seeing the outlook of others as opportunities
              to learn, can not only inspire growth within self, but can and will expand
              knowledge, build positive rapport, and show that you are flexible and open minded.</p>

              <p>Being able to see past your own agendas, and work toward a collective agenda
                for success, very much requires the ability to <strong>ACCEPT  CHANGE.</strong></p>
