          <h3 class="post-title">Follow Through</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>When you set great expectations of yourself with others, and
              they believe they will get the best from you, <em>FOLLOW THROUGH!</em>
              Always show up to opportunity dressed from the inside out for success.
            </p>

              <p>What does that mean? That means you need to be confident, ready
                to teach, and just as important, ready to listen, learn and
                understand. The effort put in to get the opportunities afforded
                you are just the beginning. Following through and seeing things
                to completion are what builds <strong>bridges of trust</strong> to even more
                opportunity and success.
              </p>

                <p>In relationships following through with good communication
                  and patience. In the workplace,  with meeting deadlines and
                  doing well and completing tasks assigned to you. In life with
                  adding tools to your toolbox and applying what you've learned.
                  Knowing when to <em>"step up and stand out"</em>, and always doing your
                  best to never break promises.

                </p>

                <p><strong>Follow through.</strong> What you put out, can always use you
                  putting more in.</p>

          <h3 class="post-title">Revel in It</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>You just accomplished a goal. Got a big promotion, graduated,
              bought that first car, <strong>GOT THAT NEW JOB</strong>, or even started doing something you've
              always wanted to do. Do you remember the moment? Do you feel it?
              The joy? The elation?
            </p>

              <p><em>Revel in it!</em> Take the time to really capture every bit of it.
                Let it take your breathe away, and be a constant reminder of
                why you strive for excellence. Why you put in the long hours,
                and hard work. Revel in the power of you, and your tenacious
                grit to be the best version of you.
              </p>

                <p>All too often our joy's are short lived. The luster of it
                  all is like a rug swept right from under our feet. Most of
                  the time we are killing our own joy. So when you accomplish
                  something, big, small. Whatever; Revel in that moment. Use
                  its energy to move you. Revel in knowing <em>"you did that"!</em>
                </p>

                <p>Feel accomplished. Feel rewarded.</p>
            <p><strong>REVEL!!!</strong></p>

          <h3 class="post-title">Unhappy Settlement</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>What you do in life every day from the time you are capable of
              controlling your actions, and make your own decisions to this
              very moment is called <em>insurance</em>. This insurance provides you the
              ability to hedge bets against your success, and if you fall a little
              short sometimes, the foundation of <strong>hard work and effort</strong>
              you have
              put in over time should and will still afford you new opportunities.
            </p>

              <p>Be mindful of the foundation you are building. The choices you
                are making, the books you read, the people you allow in your
                circle. All of these things contribute to your success or lack
                of. All of these things are a part of your life's insurance plan.
              </p>

                <p>In your life, keep your eyes on the right things that make
                  you happy. <strong>Energize</strong> yourself with the right people that have
                  your <em>goals and success</em> in mind, and know when to <em><u>respectfully</u></em> 
                  help set you back on the right path when needed.
                </p>

                <p>Don't cut the wrong checks and end up with an
                  <strong>unhappy settlement.</strong>

          <div class="post-content">
            <p><em>"I can't".</em>  <em>"I'm not confident with"</em>â€¦Two phrases that I believe
              hold many people from achieving certain goals, and losing out on
              the opportunity to take hold of the wheel in driving along the
              path to their success.
            </p>

              <p><em><strong>Own your success!</strong></em> There are many roadblocks
                and people along
                the way to your greatness that will do many things, and put
                you in many situations for potential failure. Don't be one of
                those roadblocks.  Building self awareness, confidence and
                trust will help propel you past these obstacles and reward
                you in more ways than one.
              </p>

                <p>Owning your success doesnt mean you know everything.
                  Doesn't mean you refuse to ask for help. Doesn't mean you
                  have to do everything alone. It is quite frankly, the opposite.
                  Owning your success means you know when to get a second opinion,
                  pick up a book to learn something new, or enlist the wisdom of
                  others to impart on you new knowledge that can help in
                  sculpting a better version of you.
                </p>

                <p>Owning your success means holding yourself and others
                  that are a part of your journey <em>accountable.</em>
                </p>

                <p>Do that, and surely you can be confident you will <strong>SUCCEED.</strong>

          <div class="post-content">
            <p>Ask yourself, if today were your last day, what kind of mark did
              you leave? What impression did you make on others? Did you add any
              value, or in your time, did you take more than you worked to give?
            </p>

              <p>If today were the day everyone chose to listen, what is it
                you would say? Would you express what you are feeling with
                clear thought and good intentions, or would you blab about
                your daily entertainment news?
              </p>

                <p>If today you could get back all the time you wasted, lost or

          <div class="post-content">
            <p>There are many people who struggle day to day to find the
              motivation to live life to the fullest. Some struggle with <em>money,
              time management, patience</em>, and often many struggles are caused
              by <em>mental & physical</em> health challenges.
            </p>

              <p>No matter what your struggles are, when
                you've lost motivation and drive to continue, or cannot see past
                the storm in front of you, always remember
                <strong>the power of love.</strong>
              </p>

                <p>What you love, how you love, and most importantly, who you
                  love can lift you up and help guide you through some of the
                  darkest of days. The bonds you build with those around you are
                  the best support system when you just need that extra breath
                  and energy to take the next steps forward.
                </p>

                <p>Remember,  no matter how long the journey or dark the tunnel,
                  there is a light. There is a way to win. <strong>Level of effort equals
                  opportunity</strong>, but you don't have to bare the burdens alone.
                  <strong>The power of love is strong.</strong>

          <h3 class="post-title">The Rainbow Sprinkles</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>Someone told me in an interesting discussion, they feel like life
              is a series of problems or challenges with rainbow sprinkles on top.
              Of course those sprinkles being the happy moments in life we should
              take time to cherish and appreciate.
            </p>

              <p>I usually do not agree with this sentiment,  but as we dug deeper,
                I realized yes. Yes there are more challenges at times than there
                are the existential <em>rainbow sprinkles</em>, and our society has
                morphed into an Orwell like 1984, where everyone around us is
                controlled by the number of followers they have or some new
                cosmetic alteration they can pull off or put onto their bodies.
                Roaming around like programmed drones to do one thing; what
                they are told.
              </p>

                <p>Breaking away from this day to day droll, or giving up on playing
                  the fool
                  can help eliminate lots of the challenges we face. Better
                  communication, removing the social media constructs, and having a
                  desire to be human Instead of a programmable android; <strong>This is
                  how we get to enjoy those rainbow sprinkles.</strong>
                </p>

          <div class="post-content">
            <p>Don't go your entire life living your days only to please others.
              Don't waste the time complaining about the trivial things that
              don't add up to even a minutes worth of real energy. Life has so
              many ups and downs, so many obstacles that will try to derail your
              happiness, don't lose sight of what really matters.
            </p>

              <p><em>The point of it all</em> is to be free. Build relationships.
                Love. I will say it again. <strong>LOVE!</strong>
              </p>

                <p>I remember when I lost sight of the real reasons I do what I
                  do every day of my life; <em><strong>NEVER</strong></em>. I may
                  have a bad day. I may
                  even want to be alone for a while, but I never lose the desire
                  to live and be free. I never forget there are many less
                  fortunate people in this world who give <strong>100%</strong> of themselves
                  to live, so why can't I. Why can't you?
                </p>

                <p>The point of it allâ€¦Don't fret or sweat the little things.
                  Build for bigger and better lasting memories every day!

          <div class="post-content">
            <p>Life is made up of many things all lumped into 3 major categories,
              <em><strong>Past, Present, and Future</strong></em>. So very often our human nature has us
              stuck in the past, while presently we are trying to accomplish
              greater things.
            </p>

              <p>One thing that <strong>destroys</strong> productivity, and can block you from
                real opportunity, growth, or even ruin relationships is </em>frustration
                and grudges</em>. These things are the corner stone of <u>deterioration
                and destruction</u> to many things. They have the most adverse affect
                on productivity and can aid in <em>'blinding'</em> you from achieving the
                success you seek in the goals you set.
              </p>

                <p>Whatever it is that you hold onto that boils within you from
                  these frustrations and grudges,  <strong>Let It Go!</strong> Turn it into
                  positive energy, learn from it, and use it as a motivating

                <p><u><strong>Let it Go.</strong></u> It's taking energy you need

          <h3 class="post-title">Constructive vs. Destructive criticism</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>Have you ever given someone feedback on something they were a part
              of? Or maybe you were the recipient of the feedback or the tail
              end of an expressed opinion. How did it feel?
            </p>

              <p>There are times where we will need to express our opinions or
                provide feedback to others on their performance in many situations
                in life. But the only way to be an <em>effective communicator</em> is to
                understand the difference between <strong>constructive</strong>
                and <strong>destructive</strong>
                criticism. Often enough these two forms of critique are confused
                and mis-used.
              </p>

                <p><em>Constructive criticism</em> provides pathways to learning and
                  understanding of how one can turn weaknesses into strengths.
                  Allows for growth, and let's a person walk away feeling
                  confident they can solve a problem with real solutions with
                  the right support and tuning of their efforts.
                </p>

                <p><em>Destructive criticism</em> is the exact opposite. It's draining,
                  often de-moralizing and de-motivating. Always remember,
                  <strong>blowing out someone else's candles won't make yours brighter!</strong>
                  Help build bridges to learning,  not walls to block progress.

          <h3 class="post-title">The Un-appreciated Value</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>Have you ever felt like the <em>Unappreciated</em> value in a relationship,
              Romantic, platonic or otherwise? You say, <em>"well what do you mean
              by that Mega?"</em> What I mean is have you ever been the <em>"Appreciative
              value"</em> for someone? You add value to their lives. You show up like
              a friend should. You love them how they want and need to be loved.
              You give. You compromise. You give some more. Yet you feel all of
              that goes unnoticed, and you feel all of your efforts go un-reciprocated.
              Not that you do those things for the recognition or anything in
              return, but some positive affirmations would be nice.</p>

              <p>I was asked how I handle those feelings. Those times where I
                feel like I am giving so much, and still feeling like the value
                I add and efforts I put in to help lift others up goes unappreciated.
                I feel used. At work. At home. In the world. No one wants to feel used. </p>

                <p>My answer to that is simple. Control what you can. <strong>YOU</strong>.
                  Sometimes you have to love, but give a little less. Know the
                  level of rapport you have with someone. Know the level of
                  selfish you are willing to accept from others. Know your limits
                  on what you are willing to let go unnoticed, even if it's just
                  a few words of positive affirmation from others. Know how to
                  say <strong>'No'</strong> if those you care for are not willing to step up and
                  be an <em>'Appreciative Asset'</em> in your life. Relationships on any
                  level are a give and take. But on all levels, the giving should
                  be <strong>equal in effort!!</strong></p>

          <div class="post-content">
            <p>The goingâ€¦what is it? The going is the "path" to your goals.
              And guess what? Sometimes the going gets tough! But you've got to
              keep pushing, putting in the effort to get those opportunities for
              success.  </p>

              <p>The Going gets tough,  and sometimes we feel like we want to
                give in to the negative thoughts, or the fears and scapegoats.
                But DON'T! You've got to go through what you are going through.
                In order to get to that goal, you've got to go down that path.</p>

                <p>There will be times where that path is nice and smooth, sunny
                  and bright. But when that path gets rough and rocky, tough on
                  your motivation, and dark as hell, you got to keep going. </p>

                  <p><strong>The going gets toughâ€¦but you are tougher!</strong></p>

          <h3 class="post-title">Do What Matters</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>Every day you have so much to do. At home you do your best to keep
              your house in order. In the office, you have loads of work to do.
              In life, you have so many people you feel you need to please. </p>

              <p><em>Stop!</em> Do what matters.</p>

                <p>It takes time, but spend the time to organize the realistic
                  goals in your day to day life. Take the time to breathe a
                  little, don't have this senseless thought that the <em>"constant
                  grind"</em> and tireless work is the way to success. Hard work yes,
                  is the correct path to success, but proper rest and mental
                  reprieve are just as important.</p>

          <h3 class="post-title">Appreciative Value</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p><em>Time. Money. Education.</em> These are all things we consider to have an
              appreciative value in our lives. <strong>Time</strong> allows us to experience more,
              maybe rush less or enjoy things to their capacity. Coupled with <strong>money</strong>,
              the experiences can be even greater. <strong>Education</strong> allows us to learn
              and apply new skills and possibly even share in something that
              affects positive change. Sure these things can depreciate in value,
              but managed properly, they should add great value to your life. </p>

            <p>But what about people? I had an interesting discussion the other day,
              and I realized some people have forgotten the appreciative value of
              human connection. Sharing and understanding. Some are either too
              stubborn, arrogant, jaded or maybe even too full of themselves to
              realize the great value add of the people in front of them, and
              the relationships they should work to foster and manage positively. </p>

              <p>Open your mind. Ask yourself <em>"Am I an appreciating asset in the
                lives of others around me?"</em> If the answer is truly yes, good on you.
                But if the answer is no, ask yourself <em>"why?"</em>. Could it be your
                attitude? The way you respond to people? Are you a rain cloud on
                a sunny day? Do you make others feel like you don't care?
                Is everything about you? </p>

              <p>Don't be the stock no one wants to buy. The depreciating asset.</p>

              <p>I appreciate your timeâ€¦</p>

      <h3 class="post-title">Accepting Change</h3>
      <div class="post-content">
        <p>As humans we are creatures of habit. We have tendencies to repeat
          things over and over knowing these actions yes can result in positves/successes,
          but more often than not, these habits lead to failures, pain, loss
          (opportunity, time, relationships), and even freedom.</p>

          <p>When we are unsure, or feel as if we are losing control, we run to a place of
            comfort. Think of it like a child with a teddy bear or a blanket.
            Often psychologically, we trick ourselves into believing what we are doing is
            the safest thing for us. We are naturally opposed to change.</p>

            <p>Learning to accept change, and seeing the outlook of others as opportunities
              to learn, can not only inspire growth within self, but can and will expand
              knowledge, build positive rapport, and show that you are flexible and open minded.</p>

              <p>Being able to see past your own agendas, and work toward a collective agenda
                for success, very much requires the ability to <strong>ACCEPT  CHANGE.</strong></p>
