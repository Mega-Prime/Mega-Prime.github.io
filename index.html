          <h3 class="post-title">Accepting Change.</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>As humans we are creatures of habit. We have tendencies to repeat
              things over and over knowing these actions yes can result in positves/successes,
              but more often than not, these habits lead to failures, pain, loss
              (opportunity, time, relationships), and even freedom.</p>

              <p>When we are unsure, or feel as if we are losing control, we run to a place of
                comfort. Think of it like a child with a teddy bear or a blanket.
                Often psychologically, we trick ourselves into believing what we are doing is
                the safest thing for us. We are naturally opposed to change.</p>

                <p>Learning to accept change, and seeing the outlook of others as opportunities
                  to learn, can not only inspire growth within self, but can and will expand
                  knowledge, build positive rapport, and show that you are flexible and open minded.</p>

                  <p>Being able to see past your own agendas, and work toward a collective agenda
                    for success, very much requires the ability to <strong>ACCEPT  CHANGE.</strong></p>

          <h3 class="post-title">Appreciative Value</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p><em>Time. Money. Education.</em> These are all things we consider to have an
              appreciative value in our lives. <strong>Time</strong> allows us to experience more,
              maybe rush less or enjoy things to their capacity. Coupled with <strong>money</strong>,
              the experiences can be even greater. <strong>Education</strong> allows us to learn
              and apply new skills and possibly even share in something that
              affects positive change. Sure these things can depreciate in value,
              but managed properly, they should add great value to your life. </p>

            <p>But what about people? I had an interesting discussion the other day,
              and I realized some people have forgotten the appreciative value of
              human connection. Sharing and understanding. Some are either too
              stubborn, arrogant, jaded or maybe even too full of themselves to
              realize the great value add of the people in front of them, and
              the relationships they should work to foster and manage positively. </p>

              <p>Open your mind. Ask yourself <em>"Am I an appreciating asset in the
                lives of others around me?"</em> If the answer is truly yes, good on you.
                But if the answer is no, ask yourself <em>"why?"</em>. Could it be your
                attitude? The way you respond to people? Are you a rain cloud on
                a sunny day? Do you make others feel like you don't care?
                Is everything about you? </p>

              <p>Don't be the stock no one wants to buy. The depreciating asset.</p>

              <p>I appreciate your timeâ€¦</p>
